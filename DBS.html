                Sometime after the defeat of Majin Buu, peace has returned to Earth. Goku has
                settled down and works as a farmer to support his family. His family and friends live
                peaceful lives. However, a new threat appears in the form of the God of Destruction
                named Beerus, who is known to be the most terrifying and the second most
                powerful thing in Universe Seven. After waking up from decades of sleep, Beerus
                tells his Angel assistant and teacher named Whis that he is wanting to fight the
                legendary warrior who the Oracle fish let him know about, called the Super Saiyan
                God.
