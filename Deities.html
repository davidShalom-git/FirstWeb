            <p>Gods are in the Dragon Ball franchise are responsible for maintaining balance and eliminating threats to their universe's development. They have immense power, including the ability to destroy planets and civilizations with ease, as well as access to God Ki to enhance their physical abilities. 
            Grand Zeno,the Omni-King, is the supreme ruler of all the Multiverse and seemingly its most powerful being. Since the events of the "Future" Trunks Saga, Zeno co-rules jointly with his future counterpart.Zeno destroyed six of them, leaving only twelve at the time of their introduction in Dragon Ball Super. </p>

            <h3 id="h2color">Grand Priest</h3>
            <p>The Grand Priest, befitting his position and level of strength, is a calm and collected individual. Much like his children, he is rather soft-spoken and polite, but has a direct method of speech, and orders spoken by him are followed by those below him without question. Unlike the other deities and angels, who are mortified by Gokū's casual nature towards the Zen'ō, the Grand Priest is amused at best.
            The Grand Priest appears to have insight into the Zen'ō's thoughts, and can relay his intentions to others when the need arises. Perhaps due to his long life and casual demeanor, the Grand Priest is able to casually inform the Universes of their impending destruction, showing no remorse for the huge loss of life that would also occur.</p>
